ifeatures looks useful for extra features used for classification

Many sequence to vector methods, we should choose valid and convenient. Maybe around a year old? Prod2Vec, UniProt, etc. How do we choose? We need to understand how and why we choose.

Israeli researchers Dan Oefer & Nadar Brandis (Hebrew University of Jerusalem)

Why did the last team choose ProSE and FB's models?

Definitely should use one of the BERT ones

Can check uniprot for extra datasets if needed

We can start writing the code now for the following:
  - Given an embedding model and classification dataset, produce a classification fine tune'd model
  - to do better than previous team we can have much more than 2 models and optimize

For next week:
  - Jonathan - Split up work to make generic code into small tickets
  - Anjana - TBD
  - Alexa - Look into iFeatures and see what looks useful (https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeature/)
